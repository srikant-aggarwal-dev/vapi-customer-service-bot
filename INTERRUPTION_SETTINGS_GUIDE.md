# Vapi Interruption Settings Guide

## Problem: Jeff Interrupts Before User Finishes Speaking

This is a common issue with voice AI assistants. Here's how to fix it.

## Quick Fix

Run these commands:

```bash
./fix-jeff-interruption.sh    # Shows manual dashboard settings to adjust
./update-jeff-patience.sh      # Updates Jeff's prompt to be more patient
```

## Understanding Interruption Settings

### 1. **Transcriber Settings** (Speech-to-Text)

These control when the system thinks you've stopped speaking:

- **Smart Endpointing**: Waits for natural speech pauses
- **End of Speech Threshold**: How long to wait before considering speech complete (1500-2000ms recommended)
- **Speech Detection Sensitivity**: How sensitive to voice input (0.3-0.4 = less sensitive)

### 2. **Voice Settings** (Text-to-Speech)

These control when Jeff starts speaking:

- **Interruption Sensitivity**: How easily Jeff can be interrupted (0.7-0.9 = patient)
- **Response Delay**: Buffer time before responding (800-1200ms recommended)
- **Background Noise Suppression**: Filters out non-speech sounds

### 3. **System Prompt**

Adding patience rules to Jeff's instructions:

- "WAIT for the user to COMPLETELY finish speaking"
- "If you hear silence, wait 2-3 seconds"
- "Better to wait too long than interrupt"

## Optimal Settings for Natural Conversation

| Setting                      | Recommended Value | Effect                          |
| ---------------------------- | ----------------- | ------------------------------- |
| Interruption Sensitivity     | 0.7-0.8           | Jeff waits patiently            |
| End of Speech Threshold      | 1500-2000ms       | 1.5-2 second pause tolerance    |
| Speech Detection Sensitivity | 0.3-0.4           | Less likely to trigger on noise |
| Response Delay               | 800-1200ms        | Natural conversation flow       |
| Smart Endpointing            | Enabled           | Better pause detection          |

## Step-by-Step Fix

### In Vapi Dashboard:

1. **Navigate to Jeff's Assistant**

   - https://dashboard.vapi.ai
   - Assistants → Jeff

2. **Transcriber Section → Advanced Settings**

   - Enable Smart Endpointing
   - End of Speech Threshold: 1500ms
   - Speech Detection Sensitivity: 0.3

3. **Voice Section → Advanced Settings**

   - Interruption Sensitivity: 0.7
   - Enable Background Noise Suppression
   - Response Delay: 1000ms (if available)

4. **Save Changes**

### Via API (Programmatic):

```bash
# Update Jeff's system prompt
./update-jeff-patience.sh

# This adds patience rules to his instructions
```

## Testing

After making changes:

```bash
./test-call.sh +16476278084
```

Try these test scenarios:

- Pause mid-sentence - Jeff should wait
- Take time to think - Jeff shouldn't interrupt
- Natural conversation flow - Should feel smooth

## Troubleshooting

### If Jeff Still Interrupts:

1. **Increase Settings Further**

   - Interruption Sensitivity: 0.9 (very patient)
   - End of Speech Threshold: 2000ms (2 seconds)
   - Response Delay: 1500ms

2. **Check Audio Quality**

   - Use headphones with good microphone
   - Minimize background noise
   - Ensure stable internet connection

3. **Consider Alternative Providers**
   - Cartesia: Known for better interruption handling
   - PlayHT: Good balance of speed and patience
   - Deepgram: Fast but may need higher thresholds

### Common Issues:

- **Background noise**: Enable noise suppression
- **Poor mic quality**: Jeff may misinterpret noise as speech ending
- **Network latency**: Can cause timing issues

## Best Practices

1. **For Financial Advisors (like Jeff)**

   - Patience is crucial for trust
   - Better to wait than interrupt sensitive information
   - Use higher thresholds (people need time to think about finances)

2. **Speaking Tips for Users**

   - Speak at normal pace
   - Natural pauses are fine
   - Say "um" or "uh" to indicate you're still thinking

3. **Monitoring**
   - Use `./monitor-calls.sh` to watch real-time behavior
   - Check transcripts for interruption patterns
   - Adjust based on actual usage

## Cost Considerations

More patient settings may slightly increase costs:

- Longer silences = more transcription time
- But better UX = higher conversion rates
- Worth the extra $0.01-0.02 per call

## Summary

Jeff interrupting is usually due to aggressive default settings. The combination of:

1. Dashboard voice/transcriber settings adjustments
2. System prompt patience rules
3. Proper testing

Will create a much more natural conversation flow where Jeff waits patiently for users to complete their thoughts.
