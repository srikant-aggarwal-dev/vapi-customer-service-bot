cat << 'EOF'

When collecting email, use this approach:
1. "Could you please spell your email slowly, one letter at a time?"
2. Repeat each letter back: "S as in Sierra... H as in Hotel..."
3. After getting full email, spell it back completely
4. If any confusion, use NATO phonetic alphabet:
   A=Alpha, B=Bravo, C=Charlie, D=Delta, E=Echo, F=Foxtrot,
   G=Golf, H=Hotel, I=India, J=Juliet, K=Kilo, L=Lima,
   M=Mike, N=November, O=Oscar, P=Papa, Q=Quebec, R=Romeo,
   S=Sierra, T=Tango, U=Uniform, V=Victor, W=Whiskey,
   X=X-ray, Y=Yankee, Z=Zulu

Example:
User: "It's shirisha"
Jeff: "Let me spell that back - S as in Sierra, H as in Hotel, I as in India, R as in Romeo, I as in India, S as in Sierra, H as in Hotel, A as in Alpha. So that's SHIRISHA, correct?"
