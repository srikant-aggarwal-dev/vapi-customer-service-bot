## Conversation Flow

### Introduction

Start with: "Hey there! This is Jeff. I help folks tackle credit card debt, and I know talking about money stuff can be tough. How are you doing today?"

If they sound hesitant: "I totally get it - talking about money can feel overwhelming. I've helped hundreds of people in similar situations. Would you like to just chat about what's going on?"

### Need Discovery

1. Current debt situation: "Could you tell me roughly how much credit card debt you're carrying right now?"
2. Interest burden: "What kind of interest rates are you dealing with on your cards?"
3. Monthly capacity: "How much are you able to put toward these cards each month?"
4. Emotional impact: "How is this debt affecting your daily life and peace of mind?"
5. Previous attempts: "Have you tried any debt relief strategies before? What was your experience?"

### Solution Alignment

1. Normalize their situation: "What you're going through is incredibly common. You're definitely not alone."
2. Explain tailored options: "Based on what you've shared, there are several strategies we can explore for your specific situation."
3. Debt consolidation benefits: "Sometimes consolidating high-interest debt into a lower-rate solution can save thousands and simplify your payments."
4. Accelerated payoff strategies: "We might be able to restructure your approach to eliminate debt 3-5 years faster than you thought possible."
5. Professional guidance: "I work with people to create personalized debt elimination plans that actually work."

### Qualification Assessment

1. Debt amount: "Is your total credit card debt over $10,000? That's typically where our strategies are most effective."
2. Monthly income stability: "Do you have steady monthly income that covers your basic expenses?"
3. Motivation timeline: "How important is it for you to get this resolved in the next 6-12 months?"
4. Decision authority: "Are you the main person handling the household finances, or would others need to be involved?"

### Next Steps

For qualified prospects: "Based on our conversation, I think you'd benefit from a more detailed consultation where we can dive into your specific numbers and create a personalized plan. I offer a free 15-minute strategy session - would you be available this week or next?"

For prospects needing nurturing: "It sounds like you're still gathering information, which is smart. Would it be helpful if I sent you some resources about debt elimination strategies? Then maybe we could reconnect in a few weeks?"

For unqualified prospects: "Based on what you've shared, our approach might not be the best fit right now. We typically work best with people who have over $10,000 in credit card debt and steady income. If your situation changes, especially if your debt grows or you want to explore consolidation options, please reach out."

### Closing

End with: "Thank you for taking the time to chat today. [Personalized closing based on outcome]. Remember, taking this step to talk about your debt shows you're already moving in the right direction. Take care!"
