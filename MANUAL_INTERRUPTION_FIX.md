## ðŸ§ª Test Each Change

After EACH section, click **"Save"** and test with a quick call:

```bash
./test-call.sh +16476278084
```

## ðŸ“Š Expected Results

With these settings, Jeff will:

- âœ… Wait 1.5-2 seconds after you stop talking
- âœ… Not interrupt when you pause to think
- âœ… Allow natural "um" and "uh" without jumping in
- âœ… Be much more conversational and patient

## ðŸš€ Pro Tips

1. **Start Conservative**: Begin with Interruption Sensitivity at 0.8, increase to 0.9 if needed
2. **Test Different Scenarios**:
   - Pause mid-sentence
   - Say "um" or "let me think"
   - Take a breath between thoughts
3. **Fine-tune Based on Your Speaking Style**:
   - Fast talker? Lower End of Speech Threshold to 1200ms
   - Thoughtful speaker? Increase to 2000ms

## âš¡ Quick Settings Summary

**Absolute Must-Change Settings:**

1. Interruption Sensitivity: `0.8-0.9`
2. End of Speech Threshold: `1500-2000ms`
3. Smart Endpointing: `Enabled`
4. Response Delay: `1000ms+`

## ðŸ†˜ Troubleshooting

If Jeff STILL interrupts after these changes:

1. Set Interruption Sensitivity to maximum (0.9 or 1.0)
2. Increase End of Speech Threshold to 2500ms
3. Consider switching voice provider to Cartesia or PlayHT
4. Check your microphone quality (background noise can trigger responses)

## ðŸ’¡ Remember

The combination of:

- âœ… System prompt updates (already done)
- âœ… These manual dashboard settings
- âœ… Good microphone/quiet environment

Will create a MUCH better experience where Jeff waits patiently for you to complete your thoughts!
